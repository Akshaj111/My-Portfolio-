<h1> The story of an avid astronomer!</h1>

<h4>
    Hi! I'm Akshaj! As you have read things about my programming, read this to learn more about me and my aspirations! I am 12 years old and you have probably learnt from the title that I am an avid astronomer as well as a programmer who has made many games!
    As an astronomer, I have made it my right to know whichever 'space thing' is going on, whether it be a rocket launch, or some comet passing by!
